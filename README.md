# GyroRun

Gyro Run is a fun hi-score attack challenge, written by Richard/TND.

The aim of this game is to guide your spinner around the screen, picking up treats for points. Each object will spawn at random. It is also possible that deadly skulls (which you must avoid) will appear. After time has run out, you will move onto the next level, which will get slightly much harder. A bomb will appear on the screen, you can pick up the bomb to clear the screen, and keep on scoring points. Depending on the game options selected, you will start the game three lives, unless of course you choose the hardest level of them all, which gives you only one life.
