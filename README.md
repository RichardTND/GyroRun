# GyroRun

Gyro Run is a fun hi-score attack challenge, written by Richard/TND. The project was written using C64Studio, but might also work on ACME cross assembler, if the correct pseudo code is put in place. 

# What is Gyro Run about?
Gyro Run is a fun hi score attack game in which you have to guide your spinner around the screen, picking up treats for points. Each object will spawn at random quite rapidly. It is also possible that deadly skulls (which you must avoid) will appear. After time has run out, you will move onto the next level, which will level up and get slightly much harder. A bomb also will appear on the screen. You can pick up the bomb to clear the screen of all of the spawning objects, and keep on scoring points. After the level reaches level 8, the game continues to play but you will not advance any further. Depending on the game options selected, you will start the game three lives, unless of course you choose the hardest level of them all, which gives you only one life.

# What does this game consist of?
Gyro Run contains source code for each segment of the game. The title screen, the game code, hi score table, etc. The majority of the binary files are set as raw binary format (exported from charpad). Music was made with Goat Tracker the music has been saved in PRG format, which cannot be loaded directly into Goat Tracker or SIDPLAY.
